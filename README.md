# deep-learning-challenge

## Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to build a deep learning model with TensorFlow and Keras to predict which applicants are most likely to succeed if funded by Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization.

---------------------------------
Content of the repository
---------------------------------
  - AlphabetSoupCharity.h5  <-- model for the AlphabetSoupCharity_ModelStarterCode.ipynb
  - AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5 <-- the best performing model
  - model.weights.h5 <-- Checkpoint for AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb
  - model2.weights.h5 <-- Checkpoint for AlphabetSoupCharity_optimization.ipynb

- AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb <-- first model worked on with 72% accuracy
- AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb <-- last model with the highest accuracy of 75%

----------------------------------
Instructions
----------------------------------

 * Step1: Preprocess the Data
 * Step2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
 * Step 3: Optimize the Model
 * Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
 * Step 5: Add the files to your Repo
